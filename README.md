# The other tale of the rabbit and the hedgehog - programmatic way

Once upon a time, there was a rabbit and a hedgehog. They met in the forrest
and the rabbit told everyone, who wanted to hear it (or not), that he is the
fastest animal near and far.

The hedgehog heard about that and thought "You are right by now. But in some
years, I will be faster than you".

And now, you have the java program for this
situation ;)
